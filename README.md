# A.I learns to play Atari's MsPacman
Using the "Advantage Actor Critic(A2C)" Reinforcement Learning method, the A.I 'Agent' is trained to play Atari's MsPacman.

## The Game:

The game used for this Model is Atari's MsPacman

The game was used by downloading ROM files.

## The Algorithm:

The A2C algortihm has been implemented for the Agent to play the game

refer the paper: 

[Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf)

The Python Libraries used:

[StableBaselines-3](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)

[OpenAI-Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari)

## Models:

- Mark I (1 Million TimeSteps): 

The first Model is a Preliminary Model which has been trained with 1 Million TimeSteps.

![1M](/pics/7.png)

I had first set up for 20M timesteps but I am currently able to use my CPU instead of a GPU. This is the reason why the program is halted at 1M timesteps

Anyone could clone this repo and try the same on their own or for higher TimeSteps

#### Highest Score:
